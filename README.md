![screenshot](TicTacToe.gif)

> Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who first succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. When any of the player did not succeed in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win, it becomes a draw game at the end of the posible move.
